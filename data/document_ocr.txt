This Motion seeks: the same relief on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th RFAs (Atts. 1-5) that the Court Ordered for the 3d, 4th, and 5th RFAs- clear and unqualified "admit or deny" responses; responses to basic, relevant interrogatories posed in the 3d, 4th, and 5th Interrogatories (Atts. 6-8); and production of any non-privileged documents responsive to Ms. Heard's 19th and 20th RFPs, which seek documents supporting any denials of the RFAs and documents supporting Mr. Depp's interrogatory responses (Atts. 9-10). 1 I. REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS Ms. Heard has been attempting to obtain the same "admit or deny" responses from Mr. Depp on her 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th RFAs that this Court previously ordered for Ms. Heard's 4th and 5th RFAs, and again ordered when Mr. Depp further refused to sufficiently respond to Ms. Heard's 3d RFAs. For the 4th and 5th RFAs, the Court required Mr. Depp to "admit or deny the authenticity of the documents in Ms. Heard's 4th and 5th Requests for Admissions, and for those denied by Mr. Depp shall produce all nonprivileged documents, if any, supporting such denials." Att. 11. For the 3d RFAs, the Court reconfirmed that "Mr. Depp shall admit or deny the authenticity of the photographs identified in Ms. Heard's 3rd Requests for Admissions Requests" after "receipt of the relevant and non-privileged Extracted Data from Craig Young. For any denied by Mr. Depp, he shall produce all non-privileged documents, if any, supporting such denials." Att. 12 at 1.1 The information at issue in these currently pending RFAs are photographs, articles, and emails - the exact same types of documents the Court has already ordered Mr. Depp to admit or deny their authenticity, yet Mr. Depp again refuses to properly respond and instead forces Ms. Heard to file a motion for relief the Court has now Ordered twice. With the imminent close of discovery and ongoing trial preparation, allowing the parties 1 By the time of the hearing on this Motion, Mr. Depp should have had access to all photos for some time and should be able to admit or deny the authenticity of the photos. 1 -- 
=== PAGE 3 ===
to understand what documents will need to be authenticated at trial is paramount to an efficient trial, and the exact reason Rule 4:11(e)(2) imposes no limit of RFAs related to the genuineness and authenticity of documents. Ms. Heard respectfully requests that the Court enter the same "admit or deny" Order for these 6th-10th RFAs as it did for the previous RFAs. II. INTERROGATORY RESPONSES On January 10, 2022, as part of a Consent Order, the Court authorized Ms. Heard to serve 15 additional interrogatories. Att. 13. In her 3d, 4th, and 5th Interrogatories, Ms. Heard served only 10 interrogatories, but Mr. Depp has refused to provide substantive responses to any of these Interrogatories. Third Interrogatories: Interrogatory 1 seeks basic discovery information that is requested and produced without objection in virtually every parties' Interrogatories in Fairfax- for the individuals Mr. Depp identified as having relevant knowledge in this case, describe the relevant - knowledge these individuals possess. Att. 6, Int. 1. Virginia Courts have sanctioned parties for failing to respond to this type of interrogatory. See e.g., Skibinski v. Lunger, 74 Va. Cir. 428 (Arlington Cir. 2008) (Alper, J.) (ordering the party to answer an interrogatory "seeking the identification and knowledge of all witnesses who have knowledge of the facts of the case" and ordering attorneys' fees to the party who was forced to compel this response). Yet Mr. Depp refuses to respond at all, asserting two pages of objections to this standard discovery. Ms. Heard has a right to understand what relevant information Mr. Depp is aware each of the witnesses he identified possesses, particularly where there are witnesses outside the subpoena reach of Ms. Heard for various reasons, but who may still potentially testify at trial. This is basic discovery in Virginia Courts and Plaintiff should be ordered to be produced without objection. Interrogatories 2-4 seek clearly relevant information. Mr. Depp has represented that he will provide substantive responses, but has failed to do so and refused to even commit to a date 2 
=== PAGE 4 ===
certain when he would do so. Att. 6, Int. 2-4. Interrogatory 2 requests Mr. Depp to describe supposed injuries he received at the hands of Ms. Heard. Mr. Depp not only alleges that he did not'abuse Ms. Heard, but he has made repeated allegations in his own Complaint that Ms. Heard "violently abused Mr. Depp," along with Mr. Depp's counsel claiming this at every Court hearing for two years regardless of its relevancy to the issue(s) before the Court on those occasions. Compl. [3, 6, 24-31, 63, 78(b), 89(b), 100(b)). Mr. Depp also repeated these false allegations in a Declaration that he submitted to this Court. Att. 14, 15, 7-13, 16-17, 39. Interrogatories 3 and 4 request facts supporting Mr. Depp's Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Twelfth Defenses to Ms. Heard's Counterclaim. But Mr. Depp refused to respond and claimed the Interrogatories were somehow "improper," despite Mr. Depp's own 6th ROGs containing mirror-image Interrogatories seeking facts supporting Ms. Heard's Defenses. Att. 15, Int. 1-3. Fourth Interrogatories: Ms. Heard's 4th Interrogatories contain only one interrogatory, asking - for Mr. Depp to describe "each and every incident during which You contend that Ms. Heard - inflicted any type of physical or emotional violence or abuse upon you." Att. 7, Int. 1. As already discussed, Mr. Depp has agreed to answer what injuries he supposedly received from Ms. Heard (but he has not done so yet), so there is no logical reason Mr. Depp should not describe the supposed incidents that caused these injuries. Ms. Heard has a right to know the details and facts of the supposed abuse Mr. Depp will be testifying about at trial, especially when Mr. Depp has made these allegations in his Complaint and in his own Declaration submitted to this Court. Fifth Interrogatories: Ms. Heard's final set of Interrogatories request information that relates to Mr. Depp's supposed damages, affirmative defenses, his destruction of property, and his abuse of illegal drugs. Interrogatory 1 requests Mr. Depp to identify the "recent events" from Mr. Depp's written statement immediately following the UK Judgment regarding his resigning from 3 
=== PAGE 5 ===
the role of Grindelwald, an issue indisputably relevant to causation of any alleged damages when Mr. Depp published this statement years after the publication of the Op-Ed, as any damages Mr. Depp could possibly obtain in this case must relate to Ms. Heard's Op-Ed. Att. 8, Int. 1. There is no basis for Mr. Depp to refuse to identify those "recent events" two years after Ms. Heard's Op- Ed, he simply does not want to. The Court also recently Ordered Mr. Depp to respond to discovery seeking information supporting Mr. Depp's own statements regarding causation of damages in this case. Att. 12 at 4. These are not valid bases to refuse to respond. Interrogatory 2 requests facts supporting Mr. Depp's Sixth Defenses to Ms. Heard's Counterclaim. Att. 8, Int. 2. For the same reasons as previously discussed, Mr. Depp should respond to this interrogatory. Interrogatory 3 seeks "facts supporting Your Supplemental Response to Request No. 11 of Ms. Heard's 1st Requests for Admissions that 'Plaintiff may have destroyed or damaged some type of property in the presence of Ms. Heard at some point." Att. 8, Int. 3. By answering this response and then supplementing, Mr. Depp has acknowledged the information is relevant. Ms. Heard has a right to know what property Mr. Depp admits he destroyed in her presence, which is relevant for a jury to consider when determining if Mr. Depp was a violent and volatile individual and the specific time periods he engaged in this conduct, which is all related to whether Mr. Depp assaulted and abused Ms. Heard. Similarly, Mr. Depp should respond to Interrogatory 5, which requests Mr. Depp to identify the damage he did to his rental house in Australia in March 2015, during which Ms. Heard alleged that Mr. Depp brutally abused her. Att. 8, Int. 5. Finally, Interrogatory 4 requests Mr. Depp to "identify all drugs and narcotics You have consumed or ingested at any point from January 1, 2012 to the present" not including those drugs -. 4 
=== PAGE 6 ===
prescribed by a doctor. Att. 8, Int. 4. The jury should understand all facts as to whether Mr. Depp was intoxicated during the incidents at issue, which relate to issues of credibility and recall as to what actually occurred. III. REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION 19th RFPs: These RFPs seek two types of documents. RFPs 1-5 seek documents supporting Mr. Depp's Responses to Ms. Heard's 3d Set of Interrogatories. Mr. Depp asserted his typical boilerplate objections and refused to produce any documents, despite serving identical RFPs to Ms. Heard. Att. 9, RFPs 1-5. RFPs 6-36 seek documents supporting any of Mr. Depp's denials of Ms. Heard's 6th RFAs. Att. 9, RFPs 6-36. As described above, the Court has already ordered that Mr. Depp should produce any documents supporting his denials of any RFAs. Mr. Depp should be ordered to respond to these RFAs in the same manner as previously ordered. 20th RFPs: These RFPs seek the same types of documents as the 19th RFPs. RFPs 3-4 seek documents supporting Mr. Depp's Responses to Ms. Heard's 4th and 5th Set of Interrogatories, and RFPs 5-8 seek documents supporting any of Mr. Depp's denials of any Requests in Ms. Heard's 7th-9th RFAs. Att. 10. For the same reasons already discussed, these documents should be ordered. Finally, RFP 1 seeks documents supporting the statement Mr. Depp issued when he lost the role of Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts. Just as Mr. Depp should fully respond to the corresponding Interrogatory supporting this statement for the reasons argued above, he should produce any documents supporting this statement. CONCLUSION For these reasons, Ms. Heard respectfully requests the Court grant her Motion to Compel. 5

If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Tryon shall in addition have the following rights and remedies that may, in Tryon's discretion, be exercised either cumulatively or in the alternative: (i) Tryon may require Scaramanga to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Tryon at a place or places to be designated by Tryon that is reasonably convenient to both Parties; (ii) Tryon may, in its reasonable discretion, in its name or in the name of Scaramanga, or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for, or make any compromise or settlement reasonably deemed desirable with respect to, any of the Collateral, but shall be under no obligation so to do. Tryon shall consult with Scaramanga with regard to such matters, provided that in all cases Tryon's decision shall be final. Tryon may extend the time of payment, arrange for payment in installments, or otherwise modify the term of, or release, any of the Collateral, without thereby incurring responsibility to, or discharging or otherwise affecting the liability of, Scaramanga, and Tryon will not be required to take any steps to preserve any rights of or against any party that in any way relate to the Collateral.

Tryon shall not be obligated to make any sale of the whole or any part of the Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of the Collateral may have been given. Tryon may by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, without prior notice or publication, adjour any public or private sale of the Collateral or cause the same to be adjoumed from time to time, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjoumed. In case sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by Tryon until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but Tryon shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice; (v) Tryon shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and to exercise such powers as the court shall confer upon the receiver, and Scaramanga, to the fullest extent permitted by law, hereby waives notice and the right to receive notice of any application by Tryon for such appointment; provided, however, that Tryon shall endeavor to send Scaramanga a courtesy notice of such application although the failure to send such notice shall not affect Tryon's rights under this section or elsewhere hereunder and provided further that, notwithstanding any such application or appointment, Tryon shall be entitled to apply, without notice to Scaramanga, any cash or cash items constituting Collateral in the possession of Tryon to payment of Scaramanga's Obligations under this Agreement, the Note and the other Transaction Documents; (vi) Upon any sale of any item of Collateral by Tryon hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt of Tryon shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of such item or items of Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to Tryon or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof; and/or (vii) Tryon or any holder of the Note is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Scaramanga (any such notice being expressly waived by Scaramanga), to set off and apply any and all indebtedness at any time owing by Tryon or such holder of the Note to or for the credit or the account of Scaramanga against any and all of the then-due (including, but not limited to, those due by reason of acceleration) Obligations of Scaramanga now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, the Note or any other Transaction Document, irrespective of whether or not Tryon or such holder of the - 19 OMM_US. 72469597 13 EWC_BLOOM001051 CONFIDENTIAL -- DFPP00020037

This week has not been a banner one for actor Johnny Depp who is, perhaps, most famous for his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. ------- - Credit: Disney Depp lost his libel lawsuit against Britain's The Sun newspaper publisher and, now, Walt Disney Studios has reportedly decided they want nothing to do with him if the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise gets its rumored reboot. It would seem that, although Depp wasn't being considered for a starring role in the as-yet untitled sixth POTC film, Disney executives were thinking about casting him in a smaller part - or even a cameo - as the iconic Captain Sparrow. Following the verdict of his lawsuit, however, Disney has apparently abandoned ship in regard to this idea. Although it is unsurprising that Disney would back away from the drama currently surrounding Depp - the lawsuit involved allegations of domestic violence against the actor's ex-wife Amber Heard - it is unfortunate news for fans who were hoping to see the movie series' original star return in some capacity. - 
=== PAGE 259 ===
-- Most recently, there were rumors that former Disney Channel star Zac Efron would take over as the Pirates of the Caribbean lead, perhaps as a younger version of Jack Sparrow in a prequel. Credit: Disney At present, IMDB has few details regarding the sixth Pirates of the Caribbean installment. They have noted that Joachim Rønning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil) is set to direct and Ted Elliott (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Shrek The Musical) will write the screenplay.

For Depp's part, there are currently rumors he and Tim Burton may be teaming-up again for Burton's upcoming streaming The Addams Family series. It is important to note that The Walt Disney Company has made no formal announcement regarding Pirates of the Caribbean 6 casting or Depp's return.

Sources tell The ENQUIRER the embattled actor - who embarrassed himself with a bizarre and seemingly intoxicated speech at the Hollywood Film Awards on November 14 - has entered an at-home treatment program. Rather than checking into a traditional clinic, Depp is getting help for his booze battle by participating in rehab from the comfort of his multi-million dollar Los Angeles home - a technique previously pioneered by Charlie Sheen. The treatment forced the 51-year-old to skip the premiere for his Christmas Day blockbuster "Into the Woods," which debuted at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 8, according to a top Hollywood source. "It raised a lot of questions," said the source. "People were discreetly told that Johnny is relying on professionals to help him through this fight, in private." "The decision was motivated at least in part by concerns over Johnny's privacy -- having caregivers come to him eliminates the risk of fellow patients or clinic staff spilling the beans about his treatment."

Plaintiff incorporates by reference as if fully set forth herein the General Objections contained in the Responses and Objections to Defendant's First Set of Requests for Production of Documents and Things to Plaintiff, dated September 3, 2019. 2. Plaintiff further objects to the Interrogatories on the grounds that they are overbroad, unduly burdensome, and harassing. 
=== PAGE 278 ===
3. Plaintiff further objects to the number of the Interrogatories, as they each contain multiple subparts, each of which counts toward the total number of interrogatories which Defendant is permitted to serve. 4. Plaintiff further objects to the Interrogatories on the grounds that they seek information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 5. Plaintiff further objects to the Interrogatories on the grounds that they implicate the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, and any other privilege, immunity, or protection. 6. Plaintiff further objects that the Interrogatories purport to impose obligations on Plaintiff that exceed the requirements of applicable law. OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS AND DEFINITIONS Instructions 1. In accordance with the Rules of this Court, You shall answer the following Interrogatories separately and fully, in writing, under oath. RESPONSE: No objection. 2. The answers You provide are to be signed by You. RESPONSE: No objection. 3. Where knowledge or information in Your possession is requested, such request includes knowledge of Your agent(s), employee(s), assign(s), representative(s), and all others acting on Your behalf.

For each person identified in your Responses or any of Your Supplemental Responses to Interrogatory Number 1 of Ms. Heard's 1st Set of Interrogatories, please describe fully the specific facts within the knowledge of each witness and how that person came to possess such knowledge. RESPONSE: Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by this reference the above-stated General Objections and Objections to Definitions as though set forth fully herein. Plaintiff further objects that the Interrogatory is compound. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as grossly overbroad, unduly burdensome, and harassing, because (among other reasons) it asks Plaintiff to speculate as to the knowledge of scores of other persons, as well as how each of those persons came to possess that knowledge. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it 13 
=== PAGE 290 ===
contains no limitation as to subject matter, and is utterly lacking in particularity, demanding that Plaintiff "describe fully" all "specific facts" within the knowledge of scores of other persons. The lack of specific subject matter renders the Interrogatory not merely wildly overbroad and speculative, but also vague to the point of complete unintelligibility. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that, by definition, it seeks information that is not and cannot be in possession of Plaintiff, who manifestly cannot testify as to the personal knowledge of other persons, much less the basis for that knowledge. The Interrogatory is wholly lacking in foundation, calls for speculation, and is improper in its entirety. Plaintiff can only provide evidence as to his own personal knowledge; he cannot provide evidence as to the personal knowledge of other individuals, nor can he provide evidence as to the basis of other persons' knowledge. The means to seek knowledge in possession of persons other than Plaintiff is by taking discovery from those persons, as appropriate. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it exceeds the scope of discovery permitted by applicable law; Plaintiff will designate trial witnesses in accordance with the timelines set forth in the operative Scheduling Order, but is under no obligation to explain to Defendant every fact that might hypothetically be in possession of potential witnesses identified by Plaintiff or Defendant in discovery, even if he were capable of doing so (which is not the case). Plaintiff objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome, including because it lacks any limitation as to time period. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it seeks the information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege, immunity, or protection. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it directly implicates the impressions, analysis, and opinions of counsel as to the knowledge held by potential witnesses, and the relevance of that knowledge to this proceeding, which is 14 
=== PAGE 291 ===
protected work product and not permitted to be disclosed to Defendant. As such, the Interrogatory represents an improper attempt to intrude on Plaintiff's counsel's trial preparation. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as calling for information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, nor proportional to this case. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that it seeks information that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unnecessary to the issues in this Action. Plaintiff further objects to the extent that this Interrogatory assumes facts not in evidence and relates to allegations that Plaintiff intends to disprove. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it is intended to harass Plaintiff. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it implicates the privacy of Plaintiff and numerous third persons. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it represents an improper attempt by Defendant to shift the burden of obtaining discoverable information from third parties in preparation of her case to Plaintiff. Plaintiff will not respond to this Interrogatory. 2. Describe in detail each and every alleged injury You contend You received as a result of any conduct by Ms. Heard, including but not limited to a description of the alleged injury, the date(s) and time(s) of any alleged injury, any of Ms. Heard's alleged conduct allegedly causing such injury, and any medical treatment You received related to each alleged injury. RESPONSE: In addition to the foregoing General Objections and Objections to Definitions and Instructions, which Plaintiff incorporates by this reference as if fully set forth herein, Plaintiff objects to this Interrogatory as being compound on the grounds that it features no less than six Interrogatories within one request, including subparts. Plaintiff further objects to the term "injury" as vague and ambiguous. Plaintiff construes the term to refer to physical injuries. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome to the 15 
=== PAGE 292 ===
extent it asks Plaintiff to identify and describe each and every alleged injury Plaintiff received as a result of conduct by Ms. Heard, as such injuries occurred frequently over the course of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard's relationship. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome on the grounds and to the extent that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege, immunity, or protection. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that it seeks documents and communications that are irrelevant, immaterial, or unnecessary to the issues in this Action. Plaintiff further objects to the extent that this Interrogatory assumes facts not in evidence, and contains allegations that Plaintiff intends to disprove. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory to the extent it is intended to harass Plaintiff. Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing objections, Plaintiff will provide a supplemental response to this Interrogatory. 3. Please identify and state in detail all facts supporting your Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Defenses to Ms. Heard's Counterclaim. RESPONSE: In addition to the foregoing General Objections and Objections to Definitions and Instructions, which Plaintiff incorporates by this reference as if fully set forth herein, Plaintiff objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome, including to the extent it asks Plaintiff to speculate as to the knowledge of other witnesses and how other witnesses came to possess that knowledge. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege, immunity, or protection. Plaintiff further objects on the grounds that this 16 - 
=== PAGE 293 ===
Interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion. Plaintiff further objects to this Request on the grounds that it implicates the work-product of counsel with respect to what facts relate to or support particular allegations. Plaintiff further objects that the Interrogatory is overly broad, as it relates to entire affirmative defenses. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that it seeks documents and communications that are irrelevant, immaterial, or unnecessary to the issues in this Action. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory to the extent it is intended to harass Plaintiff. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as unreasonably cumulative. Plaintiff further specifically objects to the Interrogatory on grounds of privacy, privilege, and the work-product doctrine. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it is compound and contains multiple subparts. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Plaintiff responds as follows: Plaintiff has not waived attorney-client privilege as to communications with Mr. Adam Waldman to respond to information surrounding the Fourth and Fifth Defenses to Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff's Counterclaims. Plaintiff asserts his reservation of rights and will not respond to this Interrogatory to the extent it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine sought by information surrounding the Ninth Defense to Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff's Counterclaim. However, Plaintiff will supplement this Interrogatory to provide any non-privileged responsive information. 4. Please identify and state in detail all facts supporting your Twelfth Defense to Ms. Heard's Counterclaim that "Counterclaim Plaintiff has failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate her alleged damages, if any." RESPONSE: In addition to the foregoing General Objections and Objections to Definitions and Instructions, which Plaintiff incorporates by this reference as if fully set forth herein, Plaintiff objects to this Interrogatory as overly broad and unduly burdensome. Plaintiff further objects to 17 
=== PAGE 294 ===
this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it seeks the information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege, immunity, or protection. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory as unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that it seeks documents and communications that are irrelevant, immaterial, or unnecessary to the issues in this Action. Plaintiff further objects to the Interrogatory on the grounds that it is overbroad, including because it relates to an entire affirmative defense. Plaintiff further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it implicates the work-product doctrine. Plaintiff further objects that the Interrogatory calls for a legal conclusion. Subject to and without waiting the foregoing objections, Plaintiff denies that Ms. Heard has suffered any legally cognizable damages and will further supplement this response concurrent with Interrogatory Nos. 2 and 3.

Plaintiff incorporates by reference as if fully set forth herein the General Objections contained in the Responses and Objections to Defendant's First Set of Requests for Production of Documents and Things to Plaintiff, dated September 3, 2019. 
=== PAGE 298 ===
OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS AND DEFINITIONS Instructions 1. In accordance with the Rules of this Court, You shall answer the following Interrogatories separately and fully, in writing, under oath. RESPONSE: No objection. 2. The answers You provide are to be signed by You. RESPONSE: No objection. 3. Where knowledge or information in Your possession is requested, such request includes knowledge of Your agent(s), employee(s), assign(s), representative(s), and all others acting on Your behalf. RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this instruction as overly broad and unduly burdensome, to the extent that it requires knowledge from individuals not under Plaintiff's control. Plaintiff will provide information based on his personal knowledge only. 4. Whenever appropriate in these Interrogatories, the singular form of a word shall be interpreted as its plural to whatever extent is necessary to bring within the scope of these Interrogatories any information which might otherwise be construed to be outside their scope. RESPONSE: Objection. Overbroad and vague and ambiguous. 5. Unless otherwise indicated, these Interrogatories refer to the time, place, and circumstances of the occurrences mentioned or complained of in the pleadings in this case. RESPONSE: Objection.

RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this instruction as overly broad and unduly burdensome, to the extent that it requires Plaintiff to provide information from individuals and entities not under Plaintiff's control. Plaintiff will provide information based on his personal knowledge only. 7. If You perceive any ambiguities in a question, instruction, definition, or other aspect of these discovery requests, set forth the matter deemed ambiguous and the construction used in answering. RESPONSE: Objection, overbroad. 8. If You assert a claim of privilege as to any of Your responses to the Interrogatories, state the basis for the asserted privilege, specify the privilege claimed, and include in Your answer sufficient information to permit the Court to make an informed ruling on the claim of privilege. If the claim relates to a privileged document, state the date, person or persons who prepared or participated in preparing the document, the name and address of any person to whom the document was shown or sent, the general subject matter of the document, the present or last known location and custodian of the original of the document, and the basis for the claim of privilege with respect to the document. If the claim of privilege relates to a communication, state the date(s), place(s) and person(s) involved in the communication, the subject matter of the communication, and the basis for the claim of privilege with respect to that communication. Reliance on any claim of privilege is subject to the Rules of this Court, including the production of a privilege log. RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this instruction as overly broad and unduly burdensome, to the extent that it requires Plaintiff to produce a privilege log in a specific manner at a specific time, and in response to interrogatories instead of requests for production, which exceeds the obligations under applicable law.

Plaintiff is not required, and will not identify persons with knowledge of each response or to identify each document that might have been used in preparing a response. Further, objection is made on grounds of the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, speculation, relevance, and overbreadth. 11. If, after a reasonable and thorough investigation, using due diligence, You are unable to answer any interrogatory, or any part of an interrogatory, on the grounds of lack of information available to You, specify why the information is not available to You and what has been done to locate such information RESPONSE: Objection. The instruction exceeds the requirements of applicable law, and is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and implicates the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine. Plaintiff is only required to respond (to the extent appropriate) to the interrogatories posed by Defendant, and is not required to provide an explanation of the manner in which a response was developed. 12. These interrogatories are continuing in character so as to require You to promptly amend or supplement Your responses in accordance with the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia within a reasonable time if You obtain or become aware of any further information responsive to these interrogatories.

Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request. Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgment of the Court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal.

VIRGINIA: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA JOHN C. DEPP, II : Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant, : : V. .. .. AMBER LAURA HEARD, . . Civil Action No .: CL-2019-0002911 : Defendant and .. Counterclaim Plaintiff. .. .. PLAINTIFF AND COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT JOHN C. DEPP, II'S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT AND COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF AMBER LAURA HEARD'S NINETEENTH REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION Pursuant to Rule 4:9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant John C. Depp, II ("Plaintiff" and/or "Mr. Depp"), by and through his undersigned counsel, hereby responds and objects to Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff Amber Laura Heard's ("Defendant" and/or "Ms. Heard") Nineteenth Set of Requests for Production of Documents (each, a "Request" and collectively, the "Requests"), dated January 10, 2022 and served in the above captioned action ("Action") as follows: GENERAL OBJECTIONS 1. These General Objections are incorporated into each specific response to the numbered Requests below as if fully repeated therein and are intended, and shall be deemed, to be in addition to any specific objection included in any response below. The assertion of the same, similar, or additional objections or partial responses to the individual Requests does not 
=== PAGE 332 ===
waive any of Plaintiff's General Objections. Failure to make a specific reference to any General Objection is not a waiver of any General Objection. 2. Plaintiff objects to each and every Request to the extent that the Requests (including the "Definitions" and "Instructions" identified in the Requests) (a) are overly broad or unduly burdensome; (b) are vague, ambiguous, duplicative, cumulative, or do not identify with reasonable particularity the information sought; (c) call for information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; (d) seek to impose obligations on Plaintiff beyond or inconsistent with those required by Virginia law and the rules of this Court ("Rules"); or (e) purport to seek documents or information not in Plaintiff's actual possession, custody, or control; any statement herein that Plaintiff will produce documents responsive to a specific Request means that Plaintiff will produce documents located through a reasonable search for documents in its possession, custody, and control. 3. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the discovery sought by the Requests is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. 4. Plaintiff objects to the extent the discovery sought is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. 5. Plaintiff objects to each and every Request, Definition, and Instruction to the extent that they purport to require production of documents at a specified time or place, or in a specified manner. Plaintiff will make documents available in accordance with Rule 4:9 and any agreement among the parties or orders of the Court governing the conduct of discovery. 6. Plaintiff objects to the Requests to the extent that they seek documents or information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other 2 
=== PAGE 333 ===
applicable privilege, protection, exemption or immunity. Plaintiff will produce only non- privileged information. Inadvertent disclosure of any privileged or otherwise protected documents or information shall not constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege, protection, exemption or immunity. Plaintiff reserves the right to redact documents produced in response to the Requests. 7. Plaintiff objects to the Requests, including the Definitions and Instructions contained therein, to the extent they seek documents or information protected from disclosure as being a trade secret or other confidential business or proprietary information, or documents or information that, if produced or disclosed, would result in the violation of any contractual obligation to third parties, or any applicable right to privacy of Plaintiff or third parties. 8. Plaintiff objects to any Request seeking "all" documents on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot guarantee that he has located every single document responsive to a particular Request. Subject to the general objections and any qualifications below, Plaintiff will respond to any Request seeking "all" documents by producing the responsive, non-privileged documents within its possession, custody, and control that can be located after a reasonable search conducted in good faith. 9. Plaintiff reserves the right to produce documents responsive to the Requests on a rolling basis at a time, place, and manner to be agreed on by the parties. 10. Plaintiff objects to the Requests, including the Definitions and Instructions contained therein, to the extent that they are redundant or duplicative of other specific Requests. Where information or a document may be responsive to more than one Request, Plaintiff will provide that information or produce that document only once. 3 
=== PAGE 334 ===
11. Plaintiff objects to the Requests to the extent that they purport to require the identification and/or restoration of any deleted, legacy, backup, or archival data, or otherwise seek the production of any document that is not accessible without undue burden or unreasonable expense. 12. Plaintiff objects to each of the Requests to the extent that the Requests or related Instructions purport to impose any discovery obligations on Plaintiff beyond those already imposed by applicable law. 13. Plaintiff's responses to the Requests are not intended to be, nor shall be deemed, an admission of matters stated, implied, or assumed by any or all of the Requests. In responding to the Requests, Plaintiff neither waives nor intends to waive, but expressly reserves, any and all objections as to the authenticity, relevance, competency, materiality, or admissibility at trial or during any proceeding of any information or documents produced, set forth, or referred to herein. 14. Any response by Plaintiff stating that it will produce documents is not intended as a representation that such documents exist within any requested category or categories but solely as an assertion that Plaintiff will produce (consistent with these Responses and Objections) any non-privileged, responsive documents or information within its actual possession, custody, or control that can be located after a reasonable search conducted in good faith. 15. Plaintiff objects to any factual assumptions, implications, and explicit or implicit characterizations of facts, events, circumstances, or issues in the Requests. Plaintiff's responses herein are not intended to mean that Plaintiff agrees with any factual assumptions, implications, or any explicit or implicit characterization of facts, events, circumstances, or issues in the Requests, and are without prejudice to Plaintiff's right to dispute facts and legal conclusions assumed in the Requests. 4 
=== PAGE 335 ===
16. These objections and responses are based on Plaintiff's present knowledge, information, and belief, and therefore remain subject to change or modification based on further discovery of facts or circumstances that may come to Plaintiff's attention. Plaintiff reserves the right to rely on any facts, documents, evidence, or other contentions that may develop or come to its attention at a later time and to supplement or amend the responses at any time prior to the trial. Plaintiff further reserves the right to raise any additional objections deemed necessary or appropriate in light of any further review. 17. Plaintiff objects to each Request to the extent that the Request(s) purport to require a form of forensic imaging, which is not appropriate or required as to Plaintiff's devices under the circumstances of this case.

RESPONSE: No objection. 2.

Plaintiff will produce documents from a limited number of custodians to be negotiated with Defendant in good faith. 3. Whenever appropriate in these Requests, the singular form of a word shall be interpreted as its plural to whatever extent is necessary to bring within the scope of these Requests any information which might otherwise be construed to be outside their scope. 5

If You perceive any ambiguities in a question, instruction, definition, or other aspect of these discovery requests, set forth the matter deemed ambiguous and the construction used in answering. RESPONSE: No objection. 7. If You assert a claim of privilege as to any of Your responses to the Requests, state the basis for the asserted privilege, specify the privilege claimed, and include in Your answer sufficient information to permit the Court to make an informed ruling on the claim of privilege. If the claim relates to a privileged document, state the date, person or persons who prepared or participated in preparing the document, the name and address of any person to whom the document was shown or sent, the general subject matter of the document, the present or last known location and custodian of the original of the document, and the basis for the claim of privilege with respect to the document.

=== PAGE 337 ===
the date(s), place(s) and person(s) involved in the communication, the subject matter of the communication, and the basis for the claim of privilege with respect to that communication. Reliance on any claim of privilege is subject to the Rules of this Court, including the production of a privilege log. RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this instruction as overly broad and unduly burdensome, to the extent that it requires Plaintiff to produce a privilege log in a specific manner at a specific time. Plaintiff will produce a privilege log at a time and in a manner to be negotiated with Defendant in good faith. 8. If You perceive any Request to be overly broad, unduly burdensome, or objectionable for any other reason, respond to the fullest extent possible and clearly note any objection so that the Court will be permitted to make an informed ruling on the objection. RESPONSE: No objection. 9. These Requests are continuing in character so as to require You to promptly amend or supplement Your responses in accordance with the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia within a reasonable time if You obtain or become aware of any further information responsive to these Requests. Ms. Heard reserves the right to propound additional Requests. RESPONSE: No objection. 10. Unless otherwise indicated, these requests include the time from when the parties met, in 2008.

Plaintiff objects that Defendant has failed to describe reasonably identifiable categories of documents for production and instead has improperly attempted to shift the burden to Plaintiff to analyze what documents might be deemed to "support" a particular statement, which implicates the work product of counsel. Plaintiff further objects to the Request on the grounds that Plaintiff was not involved in the creation of this document. Plaintiff further objects to the Request as being unduly cumulative and harassing. Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing objections, and without agreeing that documents supporting denials are per se discoverable, Plaintiff responds as follows: Plaintiff did not deny Request No. 28 of Ms. Heard's 6th Set of Requests for Admissions; therefore, there are no responsive documents. 48

Plaintiff further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks confidential, proprietary, and private personal and/or business information of Plaintiff and/or third parties to this litigation, which is not subject to discovery in this action. Plaintiff further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, and/or any other applicable privilege, immunity, or protection. Plaintiff further objects to this request on the grounds that it seeks documents that belong to or are in possession of third parties, and/or are not within Plaintiff's possession, custody, or control. Plaintiff further objects to this Request on the grounds and to the extent that it purports to require Plaintiff to prove a negative or otherwise speculate as to the existence of documents. Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing objections, and without agreeing that documents supporting denials are per se discoverable, Plaintiff responds as follows: Plaintiff did not deny Request No. 29 of Ms. Heard's 6th Set of Requests for Admissions; therefore, there are no responsive documents. 49

RESPONSE: In addition to the foregoing General Objections and Objections to Definitions and Instructions, Plaintiff objects to this request to the extent it refers to a Request for Admission that exceeds the statutory limit of requests for admissions that relate to the genuineness of documents pursuant to Va. R. Sup. Ct. 4:11. Plaintiff further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks documents that are neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

VIRGINIA: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA JOHN C. DEPP, II . . Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant, . . . V. .. AMBER LAURA HEARD, .. Civil Action No .: CL-2019-0002911 .. Defendant and . . Counterclaim Plaintiff. .. .. PLAINTIFF AND COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT JOHN C. DEPP, II'S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT AND COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF AMBER LAURA HEARD'S TWENTIETH REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION Pursuant to Rule 4:9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant John C. Depp, II ("Plaintiff" and/or "Mr. Depp"), by and through his undersigned counsel, hereby responds and objects to Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff Amber Laura Heard's ("Defendant" and/or "Ms. Heard") Twentieth Set of Requests for Production of Documents (each, a "Request" and collectively, the "Requests"), dated February 2, 2022 and served in the above captioned action ("Action") as follows: GENERAL OBJECTIONS 1. These General Objections are incorporated into each specific response to the numbered Requests below as if fully repeated therein and are intended, and shall be deemed, to be in addition to any specific objection included in any response below. The assertion of the same, similar, or additional objections or partial responses to the individual Requests does not 
=== PAGE 384 ===
waive any of Plaintiff's General Objections. Failure to make a specific reference to any General Objection is not a waiver of any General Objection. 2. Plaintiff objects to each and every Request to the extent that the Requests (including the "Definitions" and "Instructions" identified in the Requests) (a) are overly broad or unduly burdensome; (b) are vague, ambiguous, duplicative, cumulative, or do not identify with reasonable particularity the information sought; (c) call for information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; (d) seek to impose obligations on Plaintiff beyond or inconsistent with those required by Virginia law and the rules of this Court ("Rules"); or (e) purport to seek documents or information not in Plaintiff's actual possession, custody, or control; any statement herein that Plaintiff will produce documents responsive to a specific Request means that Plaintiff will produce documents located through a reasonable search for documents in its possession, custody, and control. 3. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the discovery sought by the Requests is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. 4. Plaintiff objects to the extent the discovery sought is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. 5. Plaintiff objects to each and every Request, Definition, and Instruction to the extent that they purport to require production of documents at a specified time or place, or in a specified manner. Plaintiff will make documents available in accordance with Rule 4:9 and any agreement among the parties or orders of the Court governing the conduct of discovery. 6. Plaintiff objects to the Requests to the extent that they seek documents or information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or any other 2 
=== PAGE 385 ===
applicable privilege, protection, exemption or immunity. Plaintiff will produce only non- privileged information. Inadvertent disclosure of any privileged or otherwise protected documents or information shall not constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege, protection, exemption or immunity. Plaintiff reserves the right to redact documents produced in response to the Requests. 7. Plaintiff objects to the Requests, including the Definitions and Instructions contained therein, to the extent they seek documents or information protected from disclosure as being a trade secret or other confidential business or proprietary information, or documents or information that, if produced or disclosed, would result in the violation of any contractual obligation to third parties, or any applicable right to privacy of Plaintiff or third parties. 8. Plaintiff objects to any Request seeking "all" documents on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot guarantee that he has located every single document responsive to a particular Request. Subject to the general objections and any qualifications below, Plaintiff will respond to any Request seeking "all" documents by producing the responsive, non-privileged documents within its possession, custody, and control that can be located after a reasonable search conducted in good faith. 9. Plaintiff reserves the right to produce documents responsive to the Requests on a rolling basis at a time, place, and manner to be agreed on by the parties. 10. Plaintiff objects to the Requests, including the Definitions and Instructions contained therein, to the extent that they are redundant or duplicative of other specific Requests. Where information or a document may be responsive to more than one Request, Plaintiff will provide that information or produce that document only once. 3 
=== PAGE 386 ===
11. Plaintiff objects to the Requests to the extent that they purport to require the identification and/or restoration of any deleted, legacy, backup, or archival data, or otherwise seek the production of any document that is not accessible without undue burden or unreasonable expense. 12. Plaintiff objects to each of the Requests to the extent that the Requests or related Instructions purport to impose any discovery obligations on Plaintiff beyond those already imposed by applicable law. 13. Plaintiff's responses to the Requests are not intended to be, nor shall be deemed, an admission of matters stated, implied, or assumed by any or all of the Requests. In responding to the Requests, Plaintiff neither waives nor intends to waive, but expressly reserves, any and all objections as to the authenticity, relevance, competency, materiality, or admissibility at trial or during any proceeding of any information or documents produced, set forth, or referred to herein. 14. Any response by Plaintiff stating that it will produce documents is not intended as a representation that such documents exist within any requested category or categories but solely as an assertion that Plaintiff will produce (consistent with these Responses and Objections) any non-privileged, responsive documents or information within its actual possession, custody, or control that can be located after a reasonable search conducted in good faith. 15. Plaintiff objects to any factual assumptions, implications, and explicit or implicit characterizations of facts, events, circumstances, or issues in the Requests. Plaintiff's responses herein are not intended to mean that Plaintiff agrees with any factual assumptions, implications, or any explicit or implicit characterization of facts, events, circumstances, or issues in the Requests, and are without prejudice to Plaintiff's right to dispute facts and legal conclusions assumed in the Requests. 4 
=== PAGE 387 ===
16. These objections and responses are based on Plaintiff's present knowledge, information, and belief, and therefore remain subject to change or modification based on further discovery of facts or circumstances that may come to Plaintiff's attention. Plaintiff reserves the right to rely on any facts, documents, evidence, or other contentions that may develop or come to its attention at a later time and to supplement or amend the responses at any time prior to the trial. Plaintiff further reserves the right to raise any additional objections deemed necessary or appropriate in light of any further review. 17. Plaintiff objects to each Request to the extent that the Request(s) purport to require a form of forensic imaging, which is not appropriate or required as to Plaintiff's devices under the circumstances of this case.

the date(s), place(s) and person(s) involved in the communication, the subject matter of the communication, and the basis for the claim of privilege with respect to that communication. Reliance on any claim of privilege is subject to the Rules of this Court, including the production of a privilege log. RESPONSE: Plaintiff objects to this instruction as overly broad and unduly burdensome, to the extent that it requires Plaintiff to produce a privilege log in a specific manner at a specific time. Plaintiff will produce a privilege log at a time and in a manner to be negotiated with Defendant in good faith. 8. If You perceive any Request to be overly broad, unduly burdensome, or objectionable for any other reason, respond to the fullest extent possible and clearly note any objection so that the Court will be permitted to make an informed ruling on the objection. RESPONSE: No objection. 9. These Requests are continuing in character so as to require You to promptly amend or supplement Your responses in accordance with the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia within a reasonable time if You obtain or become aware of any further information responsive to these Requests. Ms. Heard reserves the right to propound additional Requests. RESPONSE: No objection. 10. Unless otherwise indicated, these requests include the time from when the parties met, in 2008.

Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request. Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgment of the Court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal. My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time. Thank you for reading."

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA JOHN C. DEPP, II Plaintiff, v. ) ) ) ) Civil Action No .: CL-2019-0002911 AMBER LAURA HEARD Defendant. DECLARATION OF JOHN CHRISTOPHER DEPP, II I, John Christopher Depp, II, declare as follows: 1. I am a party in the above-entitled action. I have firsthand, personal knowledge of the facts set forth below and if called as a witness could competently testify thereto. 2. Ms. Heard's fabricated domestic violence allegations against me are categorically and demonstrably false. I have denied Ms. Heard's allegations vehemently since she first made them in May 2016, when she walked into court to obtain a temporary restraining order with painted-on bruises that witnesses and surveillance footage show she did not possess each day of the preceding week. I will continue to deny them for the rest of my life. I never abused Ms. Heard or any other woman. 3. I am bringing this lawsuit not only to clear my name and restore my reputation, but to attempt to bring clarity to the women and men whose lives have been harmed by abuse and who have been repeatedly lied to by Ms. Heard purporting to be their spokesperson. Fortunately, there is now clear evidence from over two dozen objective third parties, including police officers, former employees and neighbors of Ms. Heard's, and 4 Eastern Columbia building personnel, supported by 87 surveillance camera videos and other written and 1 
=== PAGE 424 ===
photographic that directly refute Ms. Heard's domestic violence allegations against me and other false assertions. The appearance of new evidence not previously in my possession was the impetus for my bringing this lawsuit because, after years of asserting my innocence, I am finally in a position to prove it by dismantling each element of her hoax. I set forth this evidence in detail below. 4. When confronted with direct evidence that exposes her domestic violence claims as a poorly executed yet surprisingly effective hoax, Ms. Heard responded by weaving more fantastical lies to prop up her false narrative that she is a domestic violence victim. Those lies too cannot withstand scrutiny and clear evidence. Ms. Heard's false narratives are dependent on the "evidence" of her word and that of her perjurious, co-conspirator friends who have chosen to assist her in her hoax. Those lies are internally inconsistent, shifting, and directly contradicted by overwhelming sworn testimonial, photographic, audio, video, and other evidence. And Ms. Heard has a documented history, of which I will submit evidence herein, of violence against men and women, of lying to courts and government agencies, and of suborning and attempting to suborn the perjurious testimony of third parties to deliver to courts. 5. Notwithstanding Ms. Heard's false domestic abuse alegations about me, there was actual, documented domestic violence in our relationship; she was the perpetrator, and i was the victim While mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol, My. Heard committed innumerable acts of domestic violence against me, offen in the pr third party witnesses, which in some instances caused me sejous bodily injury, Multiple of these commissions of violence against me she has even admitted to under oath. Multiple episodes of her violence against me are documented and supported by objective evidence, which I set forth below. 2 - 
=== PAGE 425 ===
Ms. Heard's Well-Documented History And Prior Arrest For Domestic Violence 6. Ms. Heard was arrested in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in 2009 after police officers observed her committing domestic violence against her then-wife Tasya Van Ree. Ms. Heard's wife asked police to arrest Ms. Heard. The King County prosecutor declined to charge Ms. Heard only because neither she nor her victim were residents of King County, Washington, but not before Ms. Heard spent a night in jail and appeared before a judge in court. Ms. Heard lied about this domestic violence incident under oath, saying "it was a trumped up charge and it was dropped immediately for being such." Ms. Heard also subsequently tried to minimize this arrest for domestic violence to the media, claiming that the police officers were "homophobic" and "misogynists." In fact, the arresting officer was a female, self-described lesbian activist who has publicly disputed Ms. Heard's claims about the circumstances of her arrest. See https://www.tmz.com/2016/06/07/amber-heard-domestic-violence-arrest-partner- tasya-van-ree/; see also https://people.com/movies/amber-heards-arresting-officer-speaks-out-i- am-so-not-homophobic/ 7. Throughout our relationship, Ms. Heard also committed domestic violence against me. She hit, punched, and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threwy objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls, and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me. As part of our divorce case, Ms. Heard was deposed on or about August 13, 2016. Ms. Heard admitted to some of these acts of violence against me in her deposition, although in the cherry-picked, sworn deposition snippet she submitted to this court, she also contradicted her own sworn admissions and further perjured herself by saying she only committed violence against me one single time. Excerpts of Amber 3 
=== PAGE 426 ===
Heard's depositions are attached here as Exhibit A. Ms. Heard also admitted under oath to throwing a can of paint thinner into my head in front of witnesses: Q: Isn't it true, Ms. Heard, that in front of two different employees at the island you threw the paint thinner and hit him in the head on December 15th? ... A: Oh, that's true ... Exhibit A. 8. "There also is an audio recording in which Ms. Heard admits to and apologizes for kicking a door into my head and punching me in the face After first denying these acts of violence under oath in her deposition, Ms. Heard was forced grudgingly to concede that she did perpetrate the violence against me that she can be heard admitting to only after being confronted with the audio recordings of her confession and apology. Excerpts of Amber Heard's depositions are attached here as Exhibit A. 9. Many people who worked for Ms. Heard and me during our marriage also observed firsthand her violence against me or observed me with injuries that she inflicted upon me immediately after the fact, which in some instances they felt compelled to document by taking photographs of my injuries. Many of them have provided sworn statements attesting to the violence they witnessed Ms. Heard commit against me. 10. Anached here as Exhibit B is a photograph of me eye caused by Heard punching me in the face on or about April 22, 2016 This photograph was taken by my bodyguard Sean Betts, who is a former 18 year veteran of the LA Sherriff's Department, on April 22, 2016. 11. Attached here as Exhibit @ are three photographs of me with scratches on my cheek, chin and nose from an incident that took place on December 15, 2015 4 These 
=== PAGE 427 ===
photographs were taken by Sean Bett at his insistence. Following a pattern she deployed throughout our relationship, Ms. Heard later perversely claimed it was I who committed violence against her on December 15, 2015, splitting her lip, bashing her in the nose so hard it nearly broke, blackening both her eyes and beating her so violently that she claimed I broke the bed in the process. Her account is disputed by multiple witnesses who each provided sworn testimony that they engaged face to face with a makeup-free and clearly uninjured Ms. Heard the following day, December 16, 2016, immediately prior to her appearance on the "James Corden" show, which can also be viewed to see the severe injuries she claims are a lie. These witnesses include Ms. Heard's own stylist Samantha McMillen, who also testified to witnessing Ms. Heard visibly uninjured on other occasions when Ms. Heard claimed I had beaten her. 12. One of Ms. Heard's attacks caused me grave bodily injury, While I was in Australia filming a movie approximately one month after I married Ms. Heard, on a day where my then-lawyer tried to discuss with Ms. Heard the need that she sign a post-nuptial agreement with me, she went berserk and began throwing bottles at me. The first bottle sailed past my head and missed, but then she threw a large glass vodka bottle. The bottle struck the marble countertop where my hand was testing and exploded. The projectile's impact shattered the bone in my finger and entirely severed he tip of my finger. Attached as Exhibit DD is a photograph of my finger. I had to have 3 surgeries to reconstruct my finger and contracted MRSA three times. I feared that i would lose my finger, my arm, and my life. 13. To conceal the fact that her domestic violence against me caused me grievous bodily injury, Ms. Heard has concocted various, shifting, false stories claiming that I cut off my own finger. First, in the midst of our divorce case, Ms. Heard caused to be leaked to the media a fake story that I cut off my finger by punching a hole in a wall. Now, Ms. Heard has crafted a 5 
=== PAGE 428 ===
new, but equally fake, story that I cut off my finger by smashing a plastic phone to smithereens while violently beating her in a "three-day ordeal." Neither of these stories is true. I did not beat Ms. Heard in Australia at any time; nor did I cut off my own finger and shatter the bones. The truth is that Ms. Heard threw a glass vodka bottle at me, and the bottle smashed on the marble countertop where my hand was resting. The impact and the broken glass shattered the bane and cut off the end of my finger To cover for Ms. Heard, I told the emergency room doctor that it happened in "an accident." The doctor knew better, and told me: "this is a wound of velocity." 14. Unfortunately, Ms. Heard's pattern of violence and abuse extends beyond me. Several women who have been in a relationship with Ms. Heard have come forward to share their personal experiences of brutal violence and other abuse at the hands of Ms. Heard. My advisors have and continue to interview these victims, who remain deeply fearful of Ms. Heard, and to collect evidence from these victims. 15. On May 21, 2016, I went to a penthouse in the Eastern Columbia Building that I owned and shared with Ms. Heard. We had not spoken for a month. 16. Our last interaction had been at my penthouse on April 21, 2016, and involved an enraged Ms. Heard physically attacking me because I was late to her birthday dinner that I threw for her and her friends. My lateness had been due to an important business meeting, of which Ms. Heard was aware. Among other violent acts, Ms. Heard punched me repeatedly in the face as I lay in bed reading after the party, leaving me with an egg shaped swelling undor my left A photograph of my injured face following her April 21, 2016 attack is attached as Exhibil B This photograph was taken by Sean Bett on April 22, 2016 after I returned to my West Hollywood home. 6 
=== PAGE 429 ===
17. After I removed myself from Ms. Heard's presence in the penthouse on April 21, 2016, the following morning Ms. Heard or one of her friends defecated in my bed as some sort of a sick prank before they left for Coachella together. Indeed, our Estate Manager Kevin Murphy told me (and later testified under oath) that Ms. Heard admitted to him that the feces was "just a harmless prank." As a result of the years of domestic abuse I had suffered at the hands of Ms. Bleard-most recently the April 21 physical attack and defecation on my bed sometime before she and her friends left the next morning-I resolved to divorce Ms. Heard. I went to pick up my things on May 21, 2016, and also resolved to tell her that I was divorcing her. I arrived at the penthouse in the early evening, and brought my two security guards Jerry Judge and Sean Bett as a precautionary measure, asking them to wait just outside the door of penthouse 3. It appeared that Ms. Heard was alone in the penthouse, although according to witness interviews, she was not. Her friend Raquel Pennington was hiding somewhere in the penthouse, although Ms. Pennington later falsely testified that she was summoned by Ms. Heard by text to Penthouse 3 at 8:06 PM, one of their many concocted lies. After I entered and went upstairs to collect personal belongings, Ms. Heard and I called our then-Estate Manager Kevin Murphy together and I asked Mr. Murphy to repeat to Ms. Heard what he had told me about her admission that the defecation in my bed was "just a harmless prank." Upon hearing Mr. Murphy's recount her admission, she went berserk and started screaming and cursing at Mr. Murphy, prompting Mr. Murphy to ultimately hang up the phone. Before he hung up, I told Ms. Heard that I intended to divorce her. She insisted on calling her friend iO Tillett Wright, who had been living rent-free in my properties for years, to try to explain away the feces that she left in my bed. 18. Ms. Heard put iO Tillett Wright on speakerphone. I had no interest in speaking with Mr. Tillett Wright. Nevertheless, both iO Tillett Wright and Ms. Heard had their chance to 7

anywhere and it has nothing to do with a case. I wouldn't be so naïve as to think that a lawyer or cop would ever use Instagram geotags because as soon as a judge found out you can change them it would get thrown out." 38. On December 16, 2015, Ms. Heard also summoned our then-Estate Manager Mr. Murphy to my penthouse to complain about the fact that I had beaten her up the night before. Mr. Murphy testified that Ms. Heard's face was utterly uninjured and unmarked, and appeared makeup free, as they spoke face to face and in good light the day after she alleged the brutal attack. Mr. Murphy also testified that Ms. Heard called him back up to the penthouse bedroom specifically to show him a clump of blonde hair on the ground purporting to be hair I had pulled out of her head. Because of Ms. Heard's demeanor and the fact that she showed Mr. Murphy a clump of hair on the floor but not the place that hair was pulled from, Mr. Murphy grew suspicious and took a time- and date-stamped cell phone photograph of the hair clump, and later compared it to the hair clump Ms. Heard submitted to the court under oath. The hair clumps do not resemble each other, as Mr. Murphy testified in his declaration. Mr. Murphy, like other eyewitnesses, also testified to the very real violence Ms. Heard committed against me, that left real injuries. 39. Cynically relying on the concept of #believewomen that that has been promoted as part of the important #metoo movement, Ms. Heard's "evidence" rests primarily on her word and that of her dependent friends. She and they have falsely accused me of violence, although interestingly none of her "witnesses" say they ever witnessed any violence. And they did this despite the inconvenient truth of my possession of e rewitn ss statements provided under penalty of perjury and photographs of her converse violence committed against me overwhelming evidence that her various abuse claims and the injuries that she claimed ensued from them are 18
